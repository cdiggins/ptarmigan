# Ptarmigan

Ptarmigan is a framework for developing Windows desktop application. It does this by providing a solid software architecture with open-source implementations of common infrastructure features.

Ptarmigan provides a rich set of functionality out of the box and provides proper decoupling of the UI and data model. This means all features can run without UI, greatly simplifying testing and development. The Calliope UI is written using WPF, but porting to other UI frameworks is easy. 

# How to use it

Ptarmigan comes with a demo application that provides user facing functionality that demonstrates many of the features implemented for the purpose of debugging, profiling, instrumentation, and testing. 

You can take this application and build from it, or use the libraries as you want. 

# Do you require more documentation, training, support, custom features, integration, or access to the road-map? 

We provide very affordable packages for users who want commercial grade support. 
Reach out to me at cdiggins@gmail.com to discuss the details. 

# Why open-source

This will be a better product because everyone can validate the source code and suggest improvements. It a is commercially friendly (MIT License) so you can use this code and libraries in your application with no attribution. You just can't change the license of the source code.
